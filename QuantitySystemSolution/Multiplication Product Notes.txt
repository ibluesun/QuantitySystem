here is another strange note

When you multiply two VECTORS with outer product
you get a matrix  because the outer product is actually
a tensor product that only work with tensors of first order (NOT RAnK)

so that 

{4 3 2} (*) {2 2 2}   result is matrix

the same operation is 
<|4 3 2|> * <|2 2 2|>  result is tensor from 2nd Order

[again because people easily refer to tensors of order 0 and 1 as scalar and vector actually makes my life harder to understand
  also the problem of algebraic rings and things and others oh my god]
