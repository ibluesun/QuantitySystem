expressing the unit in unit ladder
or MeasuringLadder

its a ladder which have Default or ParkingUnit

for example  of feet and inch

this is the LengthUnitLadder in Imperial System


or QuantityUnitsLadder

which describe the Quantity

also to not forget lets describe the whole line

Length<float> Bridge = SIUnit.Kilo<Meter>(30.23);

Pressure<int> zz = SIUnit.Mega<Pascal>(800.30);

the Meter and or Pascal should be strongly typed so that the programmer can feel it intuitive

Area<double> a1 = SIUnit.Kilo<Meter<2>>(30.21);
