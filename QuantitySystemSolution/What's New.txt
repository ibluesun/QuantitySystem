[Quantity System Framework 1.0.8.1]
- New Quantities
	Molar Mass       g/mol
	Heat Capacity    J/K
- New units
	lbmol  pound mol
	
- made feet = 0.3048 m to adjust nautical mile to be 1852m
		
[Quantity System Framework 1.0.8]

- Colors changed :)
- SpecificVolume Quantity Added
- Calculations of operators priority fixed and Parrenthesis support added.

[Quantity System Framework 1.0.7]

* New Features
	- Add support for parsing units with exponent like <cm^2>
	- Add support for simple mixed units with one '/' division charachter 
		<kg.m/s^2> gives Force Quantity
	- The first use the DLR Expressions instead of Linq Expressions 
		{this is a strategic transfer to support more features in the future}	
		{also because built in linq expressions make errors in mono under linux :( }
			
	
* New Units
	-psi  for pound per square inch  for pressure
	
* Many Fixes
	- Fixing of Metric Prefix multiplication and division  (although need testing).
	- conversion from metric units had an error because exponent wasn't taken in consideration.
	
[Quantity System Framework 1.0.6]

* New Quantities
	- Electric Charge
	- Electromotive Force
	- Capacitance
	- Electric Conductance
	- Electric Resistance
	- Magnetic Flux
	- Magnetic Flux Density
	- Inductance
	- Luminous Flux
	- Illuminance
	- Catalytic Activity  
	
* New Units
	- Coulomb 'C'
	- Farad   'F'
	- Volt    'V'
	- Siemens  'S'
	- Ohm      'ohm'
	- Weber    'Wb'
	- Teslq    'T'
	- Henry    'H'
	- Lumen    'lm'
	- Lux      'lx'
	- Katal    'kat'  => mol/s
	
	
	* Astronomical Units:
		-	AstronomicalUnit symbol changed from 'AU' to 'au'
		-   Light Year Length added                      'ly'
		-   Parsec unit  length                          'pc'  with metric support
		-   Solar Mass unit                              'Mo'
		-   Julian Year unit							 'a'
		
		
	
	-Are unit of area       symnol changed from 'a' to 'are'
	
	-u unified mass of atom  added 'u' = 'Da'
	-Dalton transfered to Natural Units
	
	* Shared Unit System added 
		The shared system contains units that exists in all unit systems
		-Second 's'  transfered to Shared unit system 
		
	* Misc Unit System added
		the system is for units that don't have exact unit system and needs to be there untill we know its unit systems

		+ Angle units
			- Arc Degree unit added  'deg'  ==>this is simple the angle degrees
			- Arc Minute unit        'arcmin'
			- Arc Second unit        'arcsec'
			- Milli Arc Second       'mas'
			- Gradian  unit          'grad'
			- Revolution  unit       'r'   whole one cycle = 360<deg>
			
		- Angstrom Transfered to Misc namespace
		
		+ Time units
			- Minute unit            'min'
			- Hour   unit            'h'
			- Day    unit            'd'	
		
		+ Volume units
			- Cubit Centimetre       'cc'	
	
	
	
* Units Logic
	Two ways in defining Quantity System of Units
		a) Make a default unit and others to reference it.
		b) Make all units reference SI units directly.	
	Either ways are acceptable but not mixed or a conversion errors occur {please refer to the code}
	
	Note: units symbols are unique and case sensitive
