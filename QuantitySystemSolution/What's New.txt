[Qs 1.1.9.85]  (Released)
- Fixed some bugs:
	Equality operator in matrix result in bad behaviour  when comparing to null.
	parsing of inner functions with named arguments.

- Scalar and Vector comparison operators is working with the norm values {absolute in scalar and magnitude in vector}

- Added checking for variable names and to prevent treating numbers as variable names.

- This will be released as attempt one before 1.2 release if things is good i'll release 1.2 soon.


[Qs 1.1.9.8]
- fixed casing error in when otherwise  statement

- fixed an exception of accessing delegate property in MONO
    replaced the call to property into a function call.
    
- Enhancing passing arguments to functions
    frankly fixed f(a) = Windows:MessageBox(a) 
    that resulted in displaying a when f(hello)
    now it shows hello :)
    
- [MassFlowRate] Quantity Added.

- Comparing Scalars with vectors is calculated based on Magnitude of the vectors.
- Comparing Vector with Vector also rely on the magnitude of vectors.
    
        
    
[Qs 1.1.9.7]
- Added Relational Operators in QuantitySystem Framework
- Added the when-othwerwise statement to evaluate conditions

  sgn(x) = -1 when x<0 otherwise 0 when x==0 otherwise 1
  
  [Success Expression] when [Test Expression] otherwise [Fail Expression]
  
  
  This is a great new feature in making conditions and it is pure function flavor in a new syntactic form.
  
  
- Planning The next major release will be 1.2  version which will hold all things together
   but after testing and making sure that there are no errors.
  

[Qs 1.1.9.5]
- Fixed namespace:variable  =  expression   assignation problem
- fast checking in function and sequence parsing to ignore the extra un-needed processing.

[Qs 1.1.9.4]
- Namespace support to sequence has been added.

[Qs 1.1.9.3]
- Modulus operator '%' added to the framework and supported into Qs
- Function overloading by parameter names:
	so you can define the same function name with different parameter names
	Qs> f(x) = x^2
	Qs> f(y) = y^2
	Qs> f(x,y) = x+y
	Qs> f(u,v) = u - v
	
	
	f(3)  call the default function
	f(y:=4) call the function that have its parameter name y
	
	The first declared function is the default function that will be called when you don't specify 
	named arguments when calling the function.
	
	when selecting named argument in calling the function the qs will try to map the desired function.
	
	NOTE: Passing functions as arguments deals only with the default function declaration.
	
- refactoring a great deal into the QsNamespace
   the QsNamespace is for providing functions variables from user defined and hardcoded in c#.
   
   


[Qs 1.1.9.2]
- Named argument in functions added.  f(y := 2, x := 3)
- Support to the DLR 0.92 by including the new references that released in 22 October {they changed a lot of things}
- Renamed [Pressure] to [Stress] and [Velocity] to [Speed].
- Added Environment:TickCount Property  it is in milli second.


[Qs 1.1.9.1]
- Setting Seuquence negative index bug (FIXED)
- Sequence range from bigger to smaller number (FIXED)
- Getting Summation , Multiplication , or Average from Bigger to Smaller number in sequence (FIXED)
- You can suppress the output by adding semi-colon ; at the end of the expression.

[Qs 1.1.9.0]
- all variables and namespaces with their functions or variables are CASE INSENSITIVE.


[Quantity System 1.1.8.3] 
- Namespace capabilities
   Namespace can be added to variables and functions.
	so this is a valid form
	
		x:r = 10
		x:g(x) = x/2
		b=g(x:r)
		
		
- Calling functions written in C#
  Namespace is mapped to Static Class in C#
  the root of Qs namespaces is [Qs.Modules]  you should add your classes here.
  
  and Public properties will serve as qs namespace variables
  public functions will server as the qs namespace functions
  
  the return values whould be QsValue.
  and function parameters are QsParameter.
  
- I included QsStudio.dll as extension module 
  this library is not completed however you can try this :)
  
  Qs> Music:Play(c d e f g a b c>)     #Play major scale on Do  
  Qs> Music:SaveMidi(c d e f g a b c>, tt.mid)
  Qs> Music:PlayMidi(tt.mid)
  Qs> Music:PlayMidi(RaisingFight.mid)   #included in the 
  
  
   

[Quantity System 1.1.8.2] (Released)
- Now Matrix operators
  '*'  for ordinary matrix multiplication
  '^'  power of ordinary matrix multiplication
  '.'  for matrix elements multiplication
  '^.' for matrix elements power.

  please let me know if you have further ideas about this arrangement.  
  
- The first manual for the program and also specifications.
  
[Quantity System 1.1.8.1] 
- Metric prefixes overflow fix
  when you form a unit <ms.s> milli second * second 
  the result is <s^2>  and an overflow occur due to the milli prefix
  this milli factor goes to the value part
  so if you entered 2<ms.s> the result will be 0.002<s^2>
  
  however the framework is always try to get the best expression it can have.
  for example if you make 2<Gm.mm> giga Metre * milli Metre the result will be 2<km^2>
  
  but if there were no corresponding prefix for the overflow then the prefix is removed 
  and overflow flag in the unit is raised, and the quantity value is altered as shown 
  in the first example.

- Still I am confused about matrix multiplication operators.
	now * operator makes array multiplication for matrix
	and . dot operator make the ordinary matrix multiplication.
	
	this is due to in calling function or sequences 
	the * operator is used and the makes the calculation of QsValue go through all elements
	I find it usefull frankly
	
NOTE:	my brain is distracted and I can't make correct judgment :(
  
  
[Quantity System 1.1.8] 

Code Design Change in Qs DLR:
-----------------------------

now there is a QsScalar class that wrap the AnyQuantity<double> class
QsScalar is inherited from QsValue
Three Classes inherited from QsValue

 1) QsScalar  
 2) QsVector
 3) QsMatrix
 
 
Later the Qs will also support Tensor with rank 3 {any suggestions is appreciated}

please notice that the matrix calculations is not the best algorithm available.


New features:
-------------

- Absolute Operator   |n|  where n is QsScalar or QsMatrix

- Vector support:
	  a= {2 3 4}  or a={2,3,5}
	  
- Dot product for vectors   New opertaor
	  {2,3,4} . { 5 6 3}
	  
- Crosss product for vectors of 3 components  use 'x' letter       New Operator
	  {3<m> 2<A> 4<N>} x {2<ft> 2<mA> 3<pdl>}
	  
- Vector Norm ||_||:
	    ||{3 5 3 2 1}|| or  ||a||

- Factorial of Vector gets all the factorial of its components

- calling a function with vector as input result in vector as a result.
  

- Matrix support 
	m1 = [2 3 4; 3 2 1; {5 4 3}]
	
- Matrix multiplication

- Determinant for matrix using determinant operator
	| a | 
	| [ 2 3 4; 3 2 1; 5 2 3] |
	only for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.
	LU decomposition methods comes later.
	
- Sequence new range operator '..' i.e. 's[n..m]':
   returns vector if elements are scalars.
   returns matrix if elements are vectors.	

- Enhancments in parsing and exceptions handling.

New Quantities:
---------------

- Stiffness						<N/m>
- RotationalStiffness			Torque / Angle
- Momentum						Mass * Velocity
- MassMomentOfInteria			I   <kg.m!^2>   like the regular mass
- AngularMomentum				Mass Moment Of Interia * Angular Velocity

New Units:
----------
- Cubit <cubit>					Ancient Length unit = 45.72<cm> based on google calculator.


[Quantity System 1.1.7] {Release}
----------------------------------

- Passing Functions as arguments.
  
- Optimization for parameterless sequqnece  {actually I am only caching elements  especially for fibonaccy like sequences}
     however sequence still need another optimizations.
     
- Run [filename] in console load the content file into the current session and execute its contents (usefull if you had coded previous functions or sequences before)


                                          
[Quantity System 1.1.6]
- Sequence concept added. in Qs ver 1.1.6


[Quantity System Framework 1.1.4] {Releases}
- Moved Exception handling from Qs layer to Console layer  so that dynamically calling for Qs will see the real exceptions.

- Fixed the Factorial for the thousand TIME :( I don't know why the function is always trick me and goes WRONG :D I must be slept or something.
   3<m>! = 6<m^3>  
   3.5<m>! = 11.6317283996629 <m^3.5>
   you can notice that factorial is accepting real positive numbers with units also :)
   this is what you should expect from treating variables as quantities.
   
- I think there are no caching errors however if any one find conversion error please revert back to release 1.1

- Not related to the program (I finished preliminary master exams today :) ) 2009-07-20  
    4 days to enter my fourth decade, 4 days and I will celebrate my 30 birthday day ;)  wish me luck.
    

[Quantity System Framework 1.1.3]
- Now Factorial is also available for real numbers
- Fixed serious caching error in units conversion

New Units
---------
- Gravitional System namespace under metric added three new units  (finally I figured out what it is really mean :) )
- <hyl> for mass
- <p>  small letter for Pond unit  which equal <gf> Gramforce  added also

- <grain> renamed to <gr>  Grain unit
- Poundal unit <pdl> added = <lbm.ft/s^2>



[Quantity System Framework 1.1.2]

- [Specific Weight] quantity added
- optimization for unit conversions  (caching added for already calculated unit conversions)

- enahcing Qs hosting to be used dynamically inside any .NET applications using DLR hosting APIs.
	to create the run time: 
            var QsScope = sr.ExecuteFile("test.qs");            
            var QsEngine = sr.GetEngine("Qs");
            var a = QsEngine.Execute("a=5<m>", QsScope) as AnyQuantity<double>;
		
- factorial optimized. {I am still searching how to make factorial for real numbers}

[Quantity System Framework 1.1.1]

- Whole optimization for the library. in all 4 basic operations
- Parsing optmization in the DLR part.
- factorial operator added '!' {calculation only occur for the integer part}


- fixed the exponent in metric units  10<m>+100<are>^0.5  produced error in calculations.

- Volume Flow Rate  quantity added
- cfm unit added  (cubic feet per minute)
- gpm unit added 


[Quantity System Framework 1.1]  [Released]
- unit modifier '!'
	the modifier will modify the lenght units to produce radius length quantities
	
	so now you can say a = 10<N.m!>  which will produce Torque

- separation between DLR and quantity system framwork

- functions are called by delegates not hard coded expressions.

- functions can refer to variables declared in global scope 
	but local parameters with the same name is habing the higher priority	

- Raise to power enhanced 
	now fractions are included so 1<kg>^0.5 = 1<kg^0.5>
	also this is a valid operation
		10<m> + 100<ha>^0.5
		
	however you can't generate quantities with fraction values.
	 only by raising to power.

	
	

[Quantity System Framework 1.0.9]

*New Features
	- Power operator has been add  x^2   -- Cautious {you only can raise to dimensionless numbers}
	- More toward DLR support: the program is entirely run under QsHost which subclass DLR ConsoleHost
	- Functions appear for the first time
		Declaration is normal like ordinary math 
			Qs> f(x) = x^2+64
			Qs> f(x,y) = x/y
		Called
			Qs> 10 - f(f(40,20))  + 20
				DimensionlessQuantity: -38 <1>	
				
*Fixes
   - Correct the <1> unit in parsing which affected <1/kg> and all units
   - Calculating numbers that start with sign - or +   (fixed)  
			so this is valid  a=-2 ++324--392 +50<m/ft> 
   - Adding Angle Quantity to Dimensionless Quantities is valid now
		-----------------------------------------
		Qs> 1 + 10 <rad>
			DimensionlessQuantity: 11 <1>
		Qs> 1 + 10 <deg>
			DimensionlessQuantity: 1.17453292519943 <1>
		Qs> 10<deg> + 1
			Angle: 67.2957795130823 deg
		Qs> 10<rad> + 1
			Angle: 11 rad   
		-------------------------------------------------
		
		and with units taken into consideration also.

		b) Make all units reference SI units directly.	
	Either ways are acceptable but not mixed or a conversion errors occur {please refer to the code}
	
	Note: units symbols are unique and case sensitive
