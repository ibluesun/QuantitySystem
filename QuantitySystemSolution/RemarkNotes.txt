Hello
-----

I discovered that I have a distracted thoughts so I am trying to collect my thoughts here sequentially
the file will describe what I will make and what I already made because I didn't keep track of things last months


Ideas:
------

1] DimensionlessQuantity is simply any variable that is have no dimensions
  so that the current valuetypes of c# like int,float, and double are dimensionless
  however in my implementation the you should declare DimensionlessQuantity explicitly
  
  by using DimensionlessQuantity you can multiply or divide it to any Quantity without dimension information
  being loss
  
  Tasks:
  - Create instance from DimensionlessQuantity    |  Done
  - Multiplication and Division                   |  need Test
  

2] Make Console Calculator to evaulate Quantities
  to illustrate the quantites calculations and other facilities to the library
  
 
  
  Tasks:
  - Console with Prompt Qs>
  - Options
	Qs> <m>
	   Unit of Length
	Accept variables
    Qs> a=1<m>   
    Qs> b=1<ft>   
    
    Simple operations 
    + - / *
    
    a+b
    c = a+ b
