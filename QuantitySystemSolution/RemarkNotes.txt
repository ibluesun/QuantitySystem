Hello
-----

I discovered that I have a distracted thoughts so I am trying to collect my thoughts here sequentially
the file will describe what I will make and what I already made because I didn't keep track of things last months


Ideas:
------

1] DimensionlessQuantity is simply any variable that is have no dimensions
  so that the current valuetypes of c# like int,float, and double are dimensionless
  however in my implementation the you should declare DimensionlessQuantity explicitly
  
  by using DimensionlessQuantity you can multiply or divide it to any Quantity without dimension information
  being loss
  
  Tasks:
  - Create instance from DimensionlessQuantity    |  Done
  - Multiplication and Division                   |  need Test
  

2] Make Console Calculator to evaulate Quantities
  to illustrate the quantites calculations and other facilities to the library
  
 
  
  Tasks:
  - Console with Prompt Qs>
  - Options
	a] Write unit in <> print the unit information and its quantity 
		Qs> <m>
		
	b] Support Variables Accept variables
		Qs> a=1<m>	  
		Qs> b=1<ft>   
    
	c] Simple operations 
		+ - / *
		a+b
		c = a+ b
		
3] 	adding two dimensionless variable made an error 
	reason: dimensionless unit is dervied unit without refernce unit that made the program add the same unit in
			the unit path
	Fixed:  don't execute the logic when the quantities are dimensional
	
4]  Multiplieng two dimensionless units or dividing them make do logic on the units
	suggestion: 
		- cancel the behacior hard coded
		- make a special unit for the dimensionless unit with <1>
			however this will remove the dynamic creation of unit which may be needed in other calculations
			especially if we need those units again in another calculations.
			
			so let the original behaviour and add exception if that if one of the two units quantity dimensionless.
