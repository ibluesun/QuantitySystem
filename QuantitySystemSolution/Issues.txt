Issue (B10: Fixed)[
    Cirlce[index] = value      #  was not working if the Circle was QsObject and index is a number
]

Issue (10: Fixed)[
1: Circle2->AttachedGrid[0]->N=20    ##not working  expression

Fixing Thoughts:
I am only handling one group and only if there were no indication to sequence
what is required is to reach the inner variable of this expression 
then making the evaluation  .. my fault is from the beginning of this project because i didn't treat the equal '=' operator as the rest of operators like -ve and +ve

so I am facing this silly situation ...
now how can that be fixed ??

i can parse all of this .. but only before the last term // because this is where I will be making the assignment operator

then i add the expression of assignment and execute it.

and this should be special case for the multiple pointer case.

	Issue(10: A)[
		There is still an open issue in setting indexer in inner property  _c->RedCircle[10]=20     where RedCircle has indexer

Issue (20:Fixed)[

Struct Conversion into QsFlowingTuple   ((when encounter property to the same type .. the program tries to get another value for this property and we go into infinite recusrsive loop)

// the anatomy of struct is like this
Struct Angle 
{
	public Angle AbsoluteAngle{get;} 
}

// solution should be to lazy evaluate these structs .. or lazy evaluate all user-defined structs

Issue (30:Fixed)[
	-6^2 == 36   which is wrong   result should be equal -1*(6^2)  == -36
