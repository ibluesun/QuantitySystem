The namespace implementation in the quantity system is to make logical domains for other functions and external functions

The operator of the namespace is the colon 

F:X = 60
F:f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2


all naming is case insensitive 

when you make external functionality based on C# code (or any other .net )
you have to make a static class with a static functions and properties.


the namespace is a provider pattern for the hardcoded functions and the user defined functions and variables

the static class name is the qs namespace name.

the QsNamespace class will hold all the functionality of the two scenarios 
some notes:

- Priority of the externa and hardcoded functions and properties of the namesapce override the userdefined functions.
- when you clear every thing from the qs memory the hardcoded namespace disappear temporarly until you call 
     something from it again.
     

Fast Tutorial:
	There is a built in namespace Math  and have Sin function and Cos function.
	
however Tan function does not exist in the namespace.

so you can define it in the namespace like this

Math:Tan(x) = Math:Sin(x) / Math:Cos(x)
